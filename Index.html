    <h1>Welcome to Templewood Primary and Nursery School</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Templewood Primary and Nursery School's website. We are a one form entry school based in a Grade 2* listed building. We have a nursery provision on site and are lucky to be surrounded by nature and open spaces, including our forest school area.</p>
    <p>Our vision is that everyone at Templewood is valued and treated with respect. Children fulfil their potential and learn without limits, through an ambitious and inclusive curriculum.</p>
    <p>We see all our pupils as individuals and within our curriculum place equal importance on the children's personal development as well as their academic progress. We know that happy children learn and through our values we ensure that children have the qualities needed to be successful through every stage of their learning journey.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Values</h2>

    <p>The ability to understand and share the feelings of others</p>
    <p><b>Honesty</b></p>
    <p>The importance of telling the truth and being responsible for your actions</p>
    <p><b>Perseverance</b></p>
    <p>Continue trying when faced with challenges and not giving up when mistakes are made</p>
    <p><B>Aspiration</B></p>
    <p>For each individual to be inspired to have their own hopes</p>
    <p><b>Challenge</b></p>
    <p>to take risks and be confident to have a go</p>
